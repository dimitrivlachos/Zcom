# ZCom

## Introduction and Overview
Welcome to "ZCom" an immersive game that combines the colony building mechanics of RimWorld, the tactical turn-based combat of Xcom, and the contract extraction systems of Hunt: Showdown. Set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies, players will guide a group of survivors to build and defend their colony against the undead threat.

## Game Concept
"ZCom" offers a unique blend of base building, resource management, exploration, and strategic combat. The game challenges players to balance between managing their colony during the day and defending against relentless zombie hordes and survivor raids at night.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Colony Building
- Players will manage resources, construct buildings, and expand their colony by assigning tasks to survivors during the day. Each survivor can complete one task during the day and one task at night:
  - Colony tasks: such as farming, construction, or research, to ensure the colony's growth and sustainability.
  - Contracts set by colony members: requiring a team to be selected and venture out to complete an objective.

### Day Missions / Contracts
- Players can send out survivors on various day missions, including resource collection, exploration of nearby areas, and gathering information about the world. These missions will provide essential supplies, knowledge, and potential allies.

### Night Defense / Contracts
- As night falls, players must fortify their colony and prepare for zombie hordes and survivor raids. They can build defensive structures, set up traps, and strategically position their survivors to repel the attacks and protect their resources.

### Combat
- When combat encounters occur during missions, the game transitions into a turn-based combat system inspired by Xcom. Players strategically command their survivors, utilizing their unique abilities and equipment to fight off the zombie hordes and hostile survivors.

## Story and Setting
"ZCom" is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The remains of humanity struggle to survive, and your colony is one of the few remaining bastions of hope. Zombies and untold monsters roam the wasteland, posing a constant threat, and survivor groups have resorted to extreme measures to secure resources. Uncover the secrets of the apocalypse and forge alliances in your journey to reclaim humanity's future.

## Art and Audio
The game will feature a stylised, gritty and desolate post-apocalyptic art style, reflecting the harsh conditions of the world. The environments will be richly detailed, showcasing abandoned cities, overgrown landscapes, and eerie ruins. The audio design will immerse players in the atmosphere, with haunting ambient sounds, tense music during combat encounters, and realistic sound effects.

## User Interface
The user interface will be designed to provide a seamless experience for both colony management and combat encounters. The UI will feature intuitive menus for building construction, resource management, and survivor assignments during the day. During combat, the UI will display information about survivor abilities, enemy positions, and turn order.

## Technical Requirements
"ZCom" will target the PC. The game will be developed using Unity as the game engine, ensuring compatibility and optimized performance across platforms, should we choose to diversify. The technical specifications and performance considerations will be finalized during the development process.

## Risk Assessment
The main risks and challenges in development include managing the scope of the game and ensuring a balance between colony management and combat gameplay. These risks will be mitigated through regular testing, prototyping, and close collaboration among the development team.
